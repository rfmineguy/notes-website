- master level checkers player

(1958) McCarthy develops lisp
(1958) Marvin Minsky

- simulated world environment
(1959) Newell and Simon
- General problem solver (Thinking Humanly)

## Reality Sets In (1966-1973)
- unrealistic predictions
- systems lacked scalability
- combinatorial explosion in search (search = looking through the possible ways of doing something)

## Minsky and Parpert
- perceptron (building block of neural networks)

## Knowledge Based Systems (1969-1979)
- the first expert systems
  + `expert system`: a program that encodes the knowledge of an expert
- Buchanan et al. 1969 `DENDRAL` project
  - dendral could build new chemical structures

Fifth gen projeect
10 yeaer plan to develop intelligent computers
Prologue language

## R1 (1982)
- configured new orders for computers
- digital saved $40 million annually

## Neural Networks (1986-?)
- connectionism arrays of perceptrons (neurons)

## AI as science (1987-?)
- data mining ("learning" from datasets)

### Neats vs Scruffies
- neats think AI theory be grounded in mathematical/logical rigor
- scruffies play around with things and see what works

- put away dishes and fold laundry (computer vision, robotics)
- translate spoken english into chinese in real time

### Sort Of
- dive safely down mission st in san francisco (high level of risk)

- performing surgery

### Cant
