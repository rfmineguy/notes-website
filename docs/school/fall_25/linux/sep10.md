## Reinserting A Distro ISO
You can reinsert the original iso file to the virtual machine

## Boot from network
PXIE is a protocol that allows for you to boot a machine from an ISO file off the network


## REMEMBER
Live environments are slow because the file system is compressed. When running the operating system of the iso, it needs to constantly compress and decompress files
