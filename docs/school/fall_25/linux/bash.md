# Bash
## Bash History
Bash maintains a history of all the commands that have been executed in `$HOME/.bash_history`

> [!NOTE]  
> `$HOME` is a bash variable that contains the path of the logged user's home directory

The bash history provides a mechanism for the shell to recall previously executed commands by using the up/down arrows
